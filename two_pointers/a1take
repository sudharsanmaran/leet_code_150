1. two pointer goes well with sorted collection
2. prevent duplicate by skipping already computed combinations rather then using set or dict


two pointer use case:
1. array sum / target sum to find target value i.e 2 sum , 3 sum, closet sum
2. Array Traversal both ends simultaneously to find specific elements, patterns, or conditions. For example, finding the
